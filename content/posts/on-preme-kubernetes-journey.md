# Background

I have a [k0s](https://k0sproject.io) cluster running locally in my house. It has three master nodes and five worker nodes.

# Why did I build this website

It took me a lot of efforts to put it together. It has been really fun to deploy and work with.

But to be honest, I really didn't have many ideas about what I should run on top of it.

So I was thinking maybe I could document the journey and some common pitfalls I stepped on when building a fully working budget k8s cluster on premise.

# Let's build something amazing

Hope you find something helpful here if you decide or already have been struggled to run some kubernetes goodness on your own homelab environment.
